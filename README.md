# Face-Filter
 A project for detecting faces and adding filters

## How to install
Download and install [2018.4.23.f1 of the Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2018.4.23).  Optionally, download and install [Unity Hub](https://store.unity.com/download) and add version 2018.4.23.f1 to your list of installs.  

Use your favorite Git client to clone the project locally (I recommend [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)).

Additionally you will need a C# editor.  I recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) as the necessary project files are part of the repo.  Be sure to install the Unity plugin if going with this option.

Next downloand and install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To be continued.
